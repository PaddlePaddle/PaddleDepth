[English](README.md)| [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

</div>
A lightweight, easy-to-extend, easy-to-learn, high-performance, and for-fair-comparison toolkit based 
on PaddlePaddle for Monocular Depth Estimation. It is a part of the Paddledepth project.


## Implemented Algorithms

As initial version, we support the following algoirthms. We are working on more algorithms. Of course, you are welcome to add your algorithms here.

## Installation
You can either git clone this whole repo by:
```
git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDepth.git
cd Paddle-Mono
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please use PaddleMono in python 3.9.

## Dataset 
see guidance in [dataset_prepare](data_prepare/data_prepare.md) for dataset preparation.

## Usage

1. Modify the configuration file in the corresponding directories in `configs`. 
2. Run the `train.py` with specified config, for example, `python train.py  --config configs/monodepthv2/mdp.yml`

* We provide shell scripts to help you reproduce our experimental results: `bash configs/monodepth/mdp.sh`.

## Customization

It is easy to design your own method with following steps:

1. Check and write your own model's to `model`
2. Write your own config file (.sh or .yml)

## Results

We present results of our implementations on the popular KITTI benchmarks with Eigen split. 

**Note:** We did not optimize the model results by additional tricks, so you can directly use the provided shell scripts to reproduce the accuracy we report in the table.

[comment]: <> (We did not perform careful parameter tuning and simply used the default config files for the . )

[comment]: <> (For MLDA Net, it is not fully aligned yet. )

[comment]: <> (We show the test accuracy using the torch weights converted to paddle.)
