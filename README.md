PaddleDepth is a lightweight, easy-to-extend, easy-to-learn, high-performance, and for-fair-comparison toolkit based 
on PaddlePaddle for depth information argumentation. It aims to create a industrial-level depth information enhancement solution to help developers using a lower cost to collect depth information.


Currently, the proposed PaddleDepth repo contains four depth information argumentation methods, including **depth super resolution, depth completion, monocular depth estimation, and stereo depth estimation**. Below is the point cloud reconstruction result by depth completion, monocular depth estimation, and stereo depth estimation.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Rich model library**:Â Paddledepth provides over 10+ SOTA models including **depth super resolution, depth completion, monocular depth estimation, and stereo depth estimation**, in which 4+ models are **self-developed and first open sourced**.
- **Simple to use**: Modular design, decoupling each network component; easy for developers to build; quick access to high-performance, customized algorithm.
- **Fair comparison**:Â All the included algorithms are trained in the same environment and training strategy for fair comparison.
